# Python Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Automation | The process of replacing a manual step with one that happens automatically |
| Client-side scripting language | Primarily for web programming; the scripts are transferred from a web server to the end-userâ€™s internet browser, then executed in the browser |
| Code editors | Tools to provide features, including syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, error checking, and autocompletion |
| Computer program|  A step-by-step list of instructions that a computer follows to reach an intended goal |
| Functions | A reusable block of code that performs a specific task |
| IDE|  A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development|
| Interpreter|  The program that reads and executes code |
| Input | Information that is provided to a program by the end user |
| Logic errors|  Errors in code that prevent it from running correctly |
| Machine language | Lowest-level computer language. It communicates directly with computing machines in binary code (ones and zeros) |
| Object-oriented programming language | Most coding elements are considered to be objects with configurable properties |
| Output | the end result of a task performed by a function or computer program |
| Platform-specific scripting language | Language used by system administrators on those specific platforms |
| Programming | The process of writing a program to behave in different ways |
| Programming code | A set of written computer instructions, guided by rules, using a computer programming language |
| Programming languages | Language with syntax and semantics to write computer programs |
| Python | A general purpose programming language |
| Python interpreter | Program that reads and executes Python code by translating Python code into computer instructions |
| Script | Often used to automate specific tasks |
|Semantics | The intended meaning or effect of statements, or collections of words, in both human and computer languages |
|Syntax | The rules for how each statements are constructed in both human and computer languages |
|Variables | These are used to temporarily store changeable values in programming code |
| Built-in functions | Functions that exist within Python and can be called directly |
 |Comments | Notes to yourself and/or other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear |
 |Data types | Classes of data (e.g., string, int, float, Boolean, etc.), which include the properties and behaviors of instances of the data type (variables) |
 |Explicit conversion | This occurs when code is written to manually convert one data type to another using a data type conversion function |
 |Expression | A combination of numbers, symbols, or other values that produce a result when evaluated |
 |Break | A way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false |
 |Control statements | Programming constructs that direct the flow of execution of a program by allowing you to make decisions, repeat actions, or choose between different code paths based on specific conditions. |
 |For loop | This executes a block of code for a specified number of iterations or over a collection of items. |
 |Infinite loop | A sequence that is missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever |
 |Iterators | Variables that allow you to loop through a collection one item at a time |
 |Loop | A sequence that makes the computer do repetitive tasks  |
 |Programming | The process of writing a program to behave in different ways  |
 |Pass | A placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement, but you don't want to execute any code or command |
 |Recursion  | The repeated application of the same procedure to a smaller problem |
 |While loop | This is used when a segment of code needs to execute repeatedly while a condition is true |
 |Implicit conversion | This occurs when the Python interpreter automatically converts one data type to another |
 |Logical operators | Operators used to combine or manipulate boolean values (True or False) to create complex conditions for decision-making.  |
 |Parameter (argument) | A value passed into a function for use within the function, controlling the behavior of the CSV reader and writer |
 |Refactoring | When a code is updated to be more self-documenting and clarify the intent  |
 |Return value | This is the value or variable returned as the end result of a function |
